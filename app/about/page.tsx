      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Hi! I'm <strong>Era</strong>, a digital artist passionate about creating atmospheric backgrounds and expressive character designs. 
        My work is heavily inspired by animated films, video games, and the beauty of everyday life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I primarily use <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong> to bring my ideas to life. Whether it's tranquil scenery 
        or dynamic storytelling illustrations, I aim to evoke emotion and imagination through my art.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it!
